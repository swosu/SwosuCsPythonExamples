'''12.12 LAB: File name change
A photographer is organizing a photo collection about the national 
parks in the US and would like to annotate the information about each 
of the photos into a separate set of files. Write a program that reads 
the name of a text file containing a list of photo file names. The 
program then reads the photo file names from the text file, replaces the 
"_photo.jpg" portion of the file names with "_info.txt", and outputs the 
modified file names.

Assume the unchanged portion of the photo file names contains only letters 
and numbers, and the text file stores one photo file name per line. If the 
text file is empty, the program produces no output.

Ex: If the input of the program is:

ParkPhotos.txt
and the contents of ParkPhotos.txt are:

Acadia2003_photo.jpg
AmericanSamoa1989_photo.jpg
BlackCanyonoftheGunnison1983_photo.jpg
CarlsbadCaverns2010_photo.jpg
CraterLake1996_photo.jpg
GrandCanyon1996_photo.jpg
IndianaDunes1987_photo.jpg
LakeClark2009_photo.jpg
Redwood1980_photo.jpg
VirginIslands2007_photo.jpg
Voyageurs2006_photo.jpg
WrangellStElias1987_photo.jpg
the output of the program is:

Acadia2003_info.txt
AmericanSamoa1989_info.txt
BlackCanyonoftheGunnison1983_info.txt
CarlsbadCaverns2010_info.txt
CraterLake1996_info.txt
GrandCanyon1996_info.txt
IndianaDunes1987_info.txt
