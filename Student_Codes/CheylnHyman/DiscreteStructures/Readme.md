Chapter 5:
    Write a program: Write a program that solves a problem iteratively, and then solve that same problem 
    with recursion. Measure the number of steps taken to solve the problem each way. Please discuss the differences.
    
Chapter 6:
    Write a program: Write a program to answer this question. Look at Example 4 in chapter 6.5. 
    Suppose a cookie shop has four different kinds of cookies. How many different ways can six cookies be chosen?
