    "We are going to build a little world where we're going to pull down some movie data and then we're going to look at it and I think the two questions that I hope to explore the 1st one is The Seven Degrees of Kevin Bacon and I want to see exactly how much of the cast and crew that's in the movie database we can actually make a connection to Kevin Bacon with within seven jumps and I think the other thing that we should do we should look for what was the most successful movie in history and I think we should quantify that by looking for the movie with the smallest budget if budget information is available and the one with the biggest ratio of turning budget into revenue so those are my two goals for right now let's go ahead and start cranking on this"
