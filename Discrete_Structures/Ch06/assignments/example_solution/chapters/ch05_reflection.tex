\begin{itemize}
  \item What surprised you about universe size (e.g., how fast $n!$ explodes)?
  \item Where did modeling get messy (caps, constraints, “illegal” combos)?
  \item Do Monte Carlo results align with theory for small $n$? Why/why not?
  \item How could simple AI/search help balance racers or discover strong builds?
\end{itemize}
