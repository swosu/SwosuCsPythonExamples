This chapter is about reading the CSV file presidents_of_virtue_plays.csv and asking
questions like a data scientist:
• Which strategies tend to finish earlier?
• How often do players trigger a Justice Burst?
• What happens to hand sizes over the course of a round?
We are not trying to build a full machine learning model (yet), but we are trying to get
comfortable with turning a log of events into structured questions and answers.
