\chapter{How Many Sundaes Can We Build?}

\section{Story Hook: Infinite Ice Cream Bar}
% - Sundae bar (or magic points / skill points) narrative:
%   * You have n scoops to distribute among k flavors.
%   * Scoops of the same flavor are indistinguishable.
% - Small concrete example:
%   * 4 scoops, 3 flavors => list all possibilities by hand.

\section{Stars and Bars: Distributing Identical Objects}
% - Translate to integer solutions:
%   * x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_k = n,  x_i >= 0.
% - Picture method:
%   * Stars for scoops, bars for dividers between flavors.
%   * Example diagrams with actual stars and bars.
% - Derive the formula:
%   * Number of solutions = C(n + k - 1, k - 1).

\section{Variants: Minimums and Caps}
% - x_i >= 1 (everyone gets at least one scoop/point):
%   * Use substitution: y_i = x_i - 1.
% - Caps / maximum constraints as challenge problems:
%   * At most 3 scoops of any single flavor.
%   * Some flavors forbidden entirely.

\section{Python Lab: Enumerating Sundaes}
% - Script sketch (sundaes.py):
%   * For small n and k, generate all integer k-tuples summing to n.
%   * Count them and compare to C(n + k - 1, k - 1) using math.comb.
%   * Optionally:
%       - Filter by min or max bounds.
%       - Print a few example tuples and map to flavor names.

\section{Practice: Scoops, Spells, and Skill Trees}
% - Exercises:
%   * Classic: distribute candies among kids, coins in piggy banks, etc.
%   * Game-themed: distribute ability points across stats (STR/DEX/INT...).
%   * Ask students to write “story → equation → stars-and-bars formula”.

\section*{Podcast: Episode 3 -- Sundae Architect}
% - Recap script notes:
%   * Characters over-build ridiculous sundaes / skill builds.
%   * Talk through stars-and-bars in informal language.
%   * Mention where stars-and-bars shows up in games and resource allocation.
%   * Tease dice, probabilities, and simulations next.
