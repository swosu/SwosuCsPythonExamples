    "## Tracking “what happened” during sorting (Stats object)\n",
    "\n",
    "This cell defines a tiny data container called `SortStats`. It’s not part of merge sort *itself*, it’s a **scoreboard** we carry along while the algorithm runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What `@dataclass` does for us\n",
    "`@dataclass` tells Python: “This is mostly just data.”\n",
    "So Python automatically creates helpful boilerplate like:\n",
    "- an `__init__` method (so we can do `SortStats()` easily),\n",
    "- a nice printable representation (so we can see the values cleanly),\n",
    "- and consistent field handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means we can focus on the *algorithm*, not on writing boring setup code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What the fields mean\n",
    "- `comparisons`: how many times we compared two items (like `left[i] <= right[j]`)\n",
    "- `writes`: how many items we placed into the merged output list\n",
    "\n",
    "These numbers give us a concrete way to test ideas from the book, like:\n",
    "- “Merging two sorted lists of sizes m and n takes at most m + n − 1 comparisons.”\n",
    "- “Merge sort has about O(n log n) comparisons overall.”\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why the “bottom half” matters (the `= 0` defaults)\n",
    "The lines:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "comparisons: int = 0\n",
    "writes: int = 0\n",
    "are default starting values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without them, Python would require you to provide values every time:\n",
    "\n",
    "SortStats(comparisons=0, writes=0)  # annoying and easy to forget\n",
    "With defaults, you can just do:\n",
    "\n",
    "stats = SortStats()\n",
    "That’s the whole point: we want a fresh, empty scoreboard every time we run the sort,\n",
    "so our measurements start at zero and the results are trustworthy."
