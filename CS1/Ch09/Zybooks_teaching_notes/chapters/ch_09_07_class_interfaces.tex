\chapter{Class Interfaces}
\label{ch:09_07_class_interfaces}

\section{Overview}
A \textbf{class interface} defines the set of methods that a programmer uses to interact with an instance of a class.  
The interface describes \emph{what} operations can be performed on an object, while the \textbf{implementation} describes \emph{how} those operations work internally.

In this section, we will explore:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How to design class interfaces for readability and reuse.
    \item How to separate interface from implementation.
    \item The use of internal methods to simplify class logic.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Key Idea:} A well-designed class acts like a mini toolbox---you can use its tools (the methods) without worrying about how each tool is built inside.

\section{Example: The RaceTime Class Interface}

Consider the following example that models a simple race timer.  
The interface includes three methods:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{\_\_init\_\_()} — creates a new RaceTime instance.
    \item \texttt{print\_time()} — prints the time to complete the race.
    \item \texttt{print\_pace()} — prints the average pace per mile.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption={A class interface consists of methods to interact with an instance.}]
class RaceTime:
    def __init__(self, start_time, end_time, distance):
        self.start_time = start_time
        self.end_time = end_time
        self.distance = distance

    def print_time(self):
        # Implementation details hidden from user
        ...

    def print_pace(self):
        # Implementation details hidden from user
        ...
\end{lstlisting}

\vspace{1em}
\noindent
\textbf{Instructor Note:} Emphasize that users of the class only need to know how to call \texttt{print\_time()} or \texttt{print\_pace()}, not how they compute their results internally.

\section{Internal (Private) Methods}
Sometimes, a class includes internal helper methods that are not meant to be accessed directly.  
By convention, these methods begin with an underscore (\_), signaling to programmers that they are used only inside the class.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption={RaceTime class with internal helper method.}]
class RaceTime:
    def __init__(self, start_hrs, start_mins, end_hrs, end_mins, dist):
        self.start_hrs = start_hrs
        self.start_mins = start_mins
        self.end_hrs = end_hrs
        self.end_mins = end_mins
        self.dist = dist

    def print_time(self):
        total_time = self._diff_time()
        print(f"Time to complete race: {total_time[0]}:{total_time[1]:02}")

    def print_pace(self):
        total_time = self._diff_time()
        total_minutes = total_time[0]*60 + total_time[1]
        print(f"Avg pace (mins/mile): {total_minutes / self.dist:.2f}")

    def _diff_time(self):
        """Internal helper method"""
        if self.end_mins >= self.start_mins:
            minutes = self.end_mins - self.start_mins
            hours = self.end_hrs - self.start_hrs
        else:
            minutes = 60 - self.start_mins + self.end_mins
            hours = self.end_hrs - self.start_hrs - 1
        return (hours, minutes)
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Abstract Data Types (ADTs) and Information Hiding}
A class can also represent an \textbf{Abstract Data Type (ADT)}, which hides the details of how data is stored or manipulated internally.  
The ADT provides a public interface for the user while keeping private methods and variables hidden.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The user sees the interface (the public methods).
    \item The developer maintains control of the internal logic.
    \item This separation prevents accidental misuse and simplifies debugging.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{1em}
\noindent
In Python, private members are not enforced, but the underscore convention signals to other programmers that a method is intended for internal use only.

\begin{quote}
\textit{“An ADT is like a vending machine—you press a button, and magic happens inside.”}
\end{quote}

\section{Quick Review}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The \textbf{interface} of a class defines what users can do with it.
    \item The \textbf{implementation} defines how it does those things.
    \item Internal methods usually begin with an underscore (\_).
    \item A well-designed class separates its interface from its implementation.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Participation Check}
\begin{itemize}
    \item True or False: A class interface consists of methods that a programmer should use to modify or access the class.
    \item True or False: Internal methods should begin with an underscore in their name.
    \item True or False: Internal methods cannot be called outside the class.
    \item True or False: A well-designed class separates its interface from its implementation.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Next Up:} In Section 9.8, we’ll learn about \textit{class customization}—defining how objects behave with built-in operators like \texttt{==}, \texttt{<}, or \texttt{+}.
