# Jeremy the Dragon, Dairy Assassin

Once upon a very weird Tuesday, in a valley that always smelled faintly of gasoline and freshly-cut hay, there lived a dragon named **Jeremy**.

Jeremy was not your standard, castle-smashing fire hazard.

By day, he owned:

* **Sunrise Dairy & Fuel** – a combination

  * dairy farm 🐄
  * gas station ⛽
  * and suspiciously good grill cheese stand 🧀

By night, however…

Jeremy was the *most feared assassin in the Dragon Mafia*.

They called him **“The Milkman”**—because he *always* delivered.

---

## 1. Sunrise at Pump #3

At dawn, the valley woke up to the same reliable sounds:

* Cows mooing
* Milk machines humming
* The *ding* of the little bell on Gas Pump #3
* And a 30-foot dragon humming Beethoven under his breath while stocking the fridge with chocolate milk

Jeremy wore an apron that said:

> “WORLD’S OKAYEST DRAGON”

He had a punch card loyalty program: buy 10 gallons, get a free ice cream cone and unsolicited life advice.

“Top it off?” he asked a sleepy trucker, curling his tail around the gas nozzle.

“Yeah, and a carton of whole milk,” the trucker yawned. “Heard it’s the best this side of the mountains.”

Jeremy winked one huge golden eye.
“Fresh from the ladies.”

He gestured toward the pasture where a dozen pampered cows stood in the morning mist, each wearing a little bell and listening to a curated playlist of chill jazz.

The trucker drove off happy.
The cows munched contentedly.
The station’s neon sign flickered from **CLOSED** to **OPEN (PROBABLY)**.

And that’s when Jeremy’s pager buzzed.

## 2. The Family Calls

Jeremy checked the screen. Just three letters:

> **DON**

He sighed, set down the crate of yogurt, and stepped into the walk-in cooler, where the air smelled like cream and destiny.

He pressed a claw to a hidden panel behind the butter.
A secret door slid open.

Behind it:

* A velvet-lined chamber
* A single red rotary phone
* A framed motivational poster that said:

  > “CRIME, BUT MAKE IT ORGANIZED.”

The phone rang once.

“Jeremy,” rumbled a deep voice when he picked up. “We got a situation.”

It was **Don Mozzarello**, the head of the Dragon Mafia. An enormous old dragon with horns like twisted breadsticks and a wardrobe of pinstriped suits.

“What’s the job?” Jeremy asked, already rolling his shoulders.

“Someone’s muscling into our territory,” the Don growled. “A rival gang. They call themselves *The Lactose Intolerants*.”

Jeremy blinked. “That’s… bold.”

“They’ve been sabotaging our operations. Dumping oat milk in our supply. Replacing our cheese with… with…” The Don lowered his voice. “Vegan alternatives.”

Jeremy gasped. “Monsters.”

“We need you to pay them a visit,” Don Mozzarello said. “And send a message.”

Jeremy flexed his wings, the cooler lights glinting off his scales.

“What kind of message?”

“The kind,” the Don said, “that comes with a receipt and a 10% discount on regret.”

## 3. Double Life, Double Shift

The trouble with being a dragon assassin *and* a small business owner is scheduling.

Jeremy checked the whiteboard by the register:

**TODAY’S TO-DO LIST**

1. Fix squeaky pump
2. Rotate milk stock
3. Assassin job – “Lactose Intolerants” (ask Don about overtime?)
4. Order more sprinkles

“Cindi,” he called to the cashier, a bored-looking barn cat in a tiny vest, “can you handle the station while I, uh… run an errand?”

Cindi squinted.
“Mafia thing or farm thing?”

“Mafia.”

She sighed and checked her planner.
“Fine. But if anybody asks why the owner’s gone, I’m telling them you’re in a milk tasting seminar.”

“That’s technically not a lie,” Jeremy said, slipping on a pair of dark sunglasses and a leather jacket that barely fit over his wings.

---

## 4. The Lactose Intolerants

The rival gang occupied an abandoned yogurt factory at the edge of town. The building’s old billboard still read:

> “GET CULTURED.”

Jeremy landed silently on the roof, his claws barely scraping the rust. He listened. Voices drifted up through a broken skylight.

Inside, a group of shady characters in matching hoodies huddled around a folding table covered in:

* Almond milk
* Oat milk
* Coconut milk
* A single, lonely carton of 2% cow’s milk in the corner, taped off like a crime scene

At the head of the table stood their leader, **Vince the Vegan Viper**, a skinny snake with a man-bun and tiny round glasses.

“Listen up!” Vince hissed. “Tonight we shut down Sunrise Dairy & Fuel. We’re replacing all their products with our new ethically-sourced, gluten-free, guilt-free, joy-free alternatives.”

The crowd cheered.
Someone snapped.
Someone else tried to clap but was holding three cartons of soy milk.

Jeremy exhaled slowly.
He could feel his dragon instincts stir.

But he wasn’t here to turn this into a bonfire. He was a *professional*.

---

## 5. Operation: Milkshake

Jeremy crashed through the skylight with dramatic, almost theatrical timing, landing in the middle of the table and sending cartons flying.

“Party’s over,” he growled, flicking glass off his leather jacket. “You’re messing with the wrong dairy.”

Vince the Vegan Viper recoiled.

“You,” Vince hissed, “are destroying the planet with cow emissions!”

Jeremy blinked.
“The cows listen to jazz and live better than I do.”

He reached into his jacket. The room tensed.

Instead of a weapon, he pulled out… a clipboard.

“Here’s what’s gonna happen,” Jeremy said calmly. “You’re going to stop sabotaging my farm. You’re going to stop targeting mafia dairies. And you’re going to sign this legally binding, totally enforceable* peace agreement.”

* (*Enforceable by one very annoyed dragon.)*

Vince squinted at the clipboard.
“You think we’re just gonna sign whatever you put in front of us?”

Behind Jeremy, his tail casually flicked the lone carton of cow’s milk off the table. It landed perfectly in his claws. He twisted the cap off and took a slow, intimidating sip.

The room watched.
Gulp.

“I think,” Jeremy said softly, “that if you don’t, my… union reps will be very disappointed.”

He snapped his claws.

A hatch in the building’s side door burst open and Jeremy’s cows charged in—helmets on, bells gleaming, hooves stomping in perfect rhythm.

They formed a line behind Jeremy like a bovine SWAT team.

Vince swallowed.
“Are those… battle cows?”

“They prefer ‘bovinary specialists,’” Jeremy replied. “But yes.”

One of the cows cracked her neck. Another chewed cud in a slow, menacing circle.

Vince signed.
Everyone signed.
Two soy milk cartons signed out of peer pressure.

## 6. Back to the Pumps

By late afternoon, the yogurt factory had a new lease on life:

* Half the facility was donated to a community kitchen
* The other half turned into a **Dairy & Non-Dairy Co-Op Café**
* A banner out front read:

  > “PEACE, LOVE, AND LACTOSE OPTIONS”

Jeremy flew back to his farm, the wind rushing past his scales, Beethoven’s *Ode to Joy* stuck in his head.

He landed just in time to see a line of customers stretching out from the station.

Cindi glared at him from behind the counter.

“You picked *today* to do mafia errands?” she asked. “We had a bus full of tourists show up. One of them tried to milk a gas pump.”

“Did you stop them?” Jeremy asked.

“Absolutely not. I filmed it for the security blooper reel.”

He grinned sheepishly and grabbed his apron again.

The rest of the evening he:

* Filled tanks
* Scooped ice cream
* Recommended chocolate milk for broken hearts
* Recommended regular milk for cookie pairings
* And recommended water for the guy who said, “I don’t really like dairy,” which Jeremy decided to accept as a character flaw, not a crime

## 7. Nightfall in the Valley

When the neon sign finally flicked to **CLOSED**, Jeremy walked out to the pasture. The stars were bright. The cows circled around him, bells chiming softly.

“You all did great today,” he said, scratching one cow behind the ears. “Especially with the intimidation tactics. Really proud of the hoof work.”

A cow mooed modestly.

Jeremy lay back in the grass, wings spread, looking up at the sky.

He was:

* A dragon
* A dairy farmer
* A gas station owner
* A mafia assassin who mostly preferred peace treaties and dramatic entrances

And somehow, all of that fit.

He hummed a bit of Beethoven, then drifted into a cozy, milk-dreamy sleep, knowing that:

* The farm was safe
* The gas tanks were full
* The Dragon Mafia was pleased
* And the Lactose Intolerants now sold both oat milk *and* his cheese under a revenue-sharing agreement, which Don Mozzarello called “diversifying the portfolio.”

---

## 8. Epilogue: Loyalty Cards & Legends

Months later, customers would whisper about **Jeremy the Dragon**:

* “He gave me a free ice cream when I was sad.”
* “His cows look… suspiciously confident.”
* “I swear his gas station jingle sounds like Beethoven.”

And somewhere in an office lined with velvet and gold, Don Mozzarello would raise a glass of perfectly chilled 2% and say:

> “To Jeremy. The only assassin I know who can close a gang war, sign a peace treaty, and still get back in time for the dinner rush.”

Back at **Sunrise Dairy & Fuel**, Jeremy flipped his sign to **OPEN**, straightened his apron, and smiled.

“Next!” he called cheerfully. “Welcome to the weirdest gas station on Earth. What can I get you—regular, premium, or chocolate?”
