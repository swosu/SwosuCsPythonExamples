# A LONG LONG TIME AGO, I CAN STILL REMEMBER HOW THE MUSIC, USED TO MAKE ME SMILE. AND I KNEW IF I HAD MY CHANCE, I COULD MAKE THOSE PEOPLE DANCE AND MAYBE THEY'D BE HAPPY FOR A WHILE. BUT FEBRUARY MADE ME SHIVER, EVERY PAPER I DELIVERED, BAD NEWS ON THE DOOR STEP, I COULDN'T TAKE ONE MORE STEP. AND I CAN'T REMEMBER IF I CRIED WHEN I READ ABOUT HIS WIDOWED BRIDE, AND SOMETHING STRUCK ME DEEP INSIDE. THE DAY. THE MUSIC. DIED.
